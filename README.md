crewAI is an open source multiagent orchestration framework created by João Moura. This Python-based framework leverages artificial intelligence (AI) collaboration by orchestrating role-playing autonomous 
AI agents that work together as a cohesive assembly or “crew” to complete tasks

## Overview
This project demonstrates the implementation of Multi AI Agents for advanced use cases using Crew AI. Multi AI agents are autonomous digital entities designed to collaborate, execute tasks, and solve complex problems by leveraging specialized expertise. By working together, they can efficiently complete tasks that would be challenging for a single AI model. This project explores multi-agent frameworks, their functionalities, and how they can be tailored to tackle various industry-specific challenges.

## What is Multi AI Agents?
Multi AI Agents refer to a system where multiple specialized AI models or agents collaborate to achieve specific objectives. Each agent is typically designed with unique skills or knowledge to contribute to the task at hand, and they communicate and work together to produce a cohesive solution. These agents may include models trained for different tasks such as Natural Language Processing (NLP), Computer Vision (CV), recommendation systems, or problem-solving.

## Libraries Used
- python >=10 <=13
- openai
- torch==2.0.1
- matplotlib==3.7.2
- crewai==0.75
- crewai_tools==0.12.1

## Key Features of Multi AI Agents:

- Specialization: Each agent has a unique specialization, allowing it to focus on specific subtasks.
- Collaboration: Agents work together by sharing information, distributing tasks, and combining outputs.
- Autonomy: Each agent can operate independently to some degree and make decisions based on its environment.
- Adaptability: Agents adapt to new information, context, or environments, providing flexibility for dynamic use cases.

## To Perform Activities in Parallel

In a Multi AI Agent system, agents are deployed to handle different aspects of a complex problem. They communicate with each other through protocols that enable them to:

- Divide Tasks: Large tasks are broken down into smaller subtasks and assigned to the agent most capable of handling each subtask.
- Share Information: Agents pass relevant data and insights to each other, facilitating informed decision-making.
- Coordinate Actions: Some agents act as orchestrators, managing the workflow to ensure tasks are completed in a structured, efficient manner.
- Aggregate Results: Outputs from various agents are aggregated, refined, and presented as a single cohesive result.

## Industry Use Cases
Multi AI Agents have transformative applications across various industries:
